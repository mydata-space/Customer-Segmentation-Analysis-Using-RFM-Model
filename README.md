# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-Using-RFM-Model

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to identify key customer groups based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset contained 2,823 sales records from an international sales company, covering transactions from 2003 to 2005.
Using 100% SQL , I analyzed sales trends, identified high-value customers, and categorized them into different segments to help the business improve customer retention and marketing strategies.

## Key Analysis & Insights 

### 1. Sales Performance by Product Line & Year
- Classic Cars generated the highest revenue, followed by Vintage Cars.
- 2004 was the best-performing year, while 2005 had lower sales due to only 5 months of operations.
- November was the peak sales month, with Classic Cars being the top-selling product.

### 2. Customer Segmentation (RFM Model)
I categorized customers into different segments based on:
- Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency (F): How often they purchase.
- Monetary (M): How much they spend.

### Customer Segments Identified:
- Loyal Customers: High spenders who purchase frequently.
- Active Customers: Regular buyers who may need engagement to retain.
- Potential Churners: Customers at risk of leaving.
- Lost Customers: Inactive customers who havenâ€™t purchased in a while.

### 3. Business Recommendations
- Target Loyal & Active Customers with exclusive offers to maximize retention.
- Re-engage Lost & Slipping Away Customers through personalized promotions.

## Tools & Techniques Used
*SQL (80%): Data exploration, aggregation, CTEs and RFM scoring.*

### 4. Limitations of the Analysis
- Incomplete Data for 2005
The dataset only includes sales records from January to May 2005, making it difficult to compare yearly performance accurately.
- Small Customer Sample Size
The RFM model was applied to only 92 unique customers, which may limit the statistical reliability of segmentation.
A larger dataset would provide more robust insights into customer behavior patterns.

## Projet Contribution 
This analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior, optimize marketing efforts, and increase profitability by focusing on the right customer groups.
